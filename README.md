# BoxOffice

I ran the theatre box office as a volunteer at my son's school for a few years.
It was always difficult to find enough volunteers to cover all the shifts and sell tickets. 
I would email everyone a list of open shifts and get 10 people all volunteering for one shift and no one any of the others.

What I needed was:
*	To know when the box office was open
*	A way for volunteers to know in real time which shifts were filled and which ones were in need.
*	Signup for any and all shifts they could fill.
*	Get email reminders of their upcoming shift.
*	Allow me to print/email the schedule for anyone who wanted a copy
