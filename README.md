# BoxOffice

I ran the theatre box office as a volunteer at my son's school for a few years.
It was difficult to find enough volunteers to man the box office and sell tickets. 
Very often I would have 10 people all volunteering for one shift and no one for many others.
I built this scheduling app to allow people to:
	1. See when the box office was open
	2. Know which shifts were filled and which ones were in need.
	3. Signup for any and all shifts they could fill.
	4. Get email reminders of their upcoming shift.
	5. Allow me to print/email the schedule for anyone wh wanted a copy
